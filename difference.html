        <br> &nbsp;

        <p> <strong>"A programming language is a way by which programmers communicate with computers to
                build
                desktop apps, websites, and mobile apps
                through the set of instructions known as code/program."</strong>It’s a sequence of
            instructions written to
            accomplish a given goal. C, C++, Java, Python are some of the examples of programming
            languages. Programming languages usually consist of two components-syntax(form) and
            semantics(meaning). They are used to implement algorithms and enable computers to perform
            actions.</p>
            <p id="p2">Programming languages can be classified into three categories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li> Machine language- Machine language is a type of low-level language that computers can
                understand easily. They are composed of instructions in binary or hexadecimal and are
                the elemental language of computers.</li>
            <li>Assembly language- Assembly language (ASM) is yet another low-level programming language
                created for specific processors. It is just a symbolic and human-understandable
                representation of the collection of instructions. It translates assembly language to
                machine
                language using an assembler.</li>
            <li>High level language- HLL is a high-level programming language that is used to create
                user-friendly software and websites. This programming language necessitates the use of a
                compiler or interpreter to convert the code written by the user to the machine language
                (language understood by the computer). A high-level language’s main advantage is that it
                is
                simple to read, write, and maintain. Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Cobol,
                Perl,
                Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift are examples of high-level programming
                languages.High-level
                language can be further divided into:
                <br>
                (I)Procedural-oriented programming languages <br>
                (II)Object-oriented programming languages <br>
                (III)Natural Language
        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Simplicity: Most modern languages like Python have a simple learning curve. There is
                                usually a tradeoff between
                                the simplicity of a language and its speed and abstraction (ability to hide complicated
                                details).
                                Structure: Every programming language follows a proper predefined structure like
                                predefined syntax, semantics,
                                set of rules, etc.</li>
                            <li>Abstraction: It refers to the ability of the programming language to hide complicated
                                details which might be
                                unnecessary for the users. It is one of the most important and essential features of
                                object-oriented programming
                                languages.</li>
                            <li>Efficiency: To avoid consuming too much memory or taking too long, programming languages
                                are translated and
                                performed efficiently.</li>
                            <li>Portability: Programming languages are portable, which means that they should be simple
                                to transfer from one
                                computer to another.</li>

            <h2 id="s1">Scripting Language</h2>


            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/978673097131581440/980124326286229504/scripting-language.png"
                class="img-fluid" alt="">
            &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;

            <p><strong>"A scripting language is a type of programming language which does not require
                    explicit compilation step, and it is designed for a runtime system to automate the
                    execution of tasks."</strong> A scripting language is a programming language designed
                specifically for runtime
                environments. It automates the execution of tasks. They are used in system administration,
                web development, games, and creating plugins and extensions. These languages are interpreted
                languages (An Interpreter executes instructions written in a programming or scripting
                language directly, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine
                language program), and they bring new functionalities to the applications. These languages
                are usually short and snappy and are interpreted from the source or byte code. Mostly,
                scripting languages are open-sourced languages and are supported by almost every platform,
                which means that no special kind of software is required to run them, as they are a set of
                commands run without the use of a compiler.</p>
                <p id="s2">Depending on your aim and circumstances, using a scripting language is better. There are two
                main types of scripting languages-</p>

            <p> Server-side scripting language: Server-side scripting languages are used to create dynamic
                web pages. They are executed at a web server. These languages perform backend operations.
                Examples- PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, and Pearl.</p>
            <p>Client-side scripting language: Client-side scripting language runs off the browsers. These
                languages are considered front end languages. Examples- HTML, jQuery, CSS and JavaScript.
            </p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">

                        &nbsp;
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easy to learn and use- They are often a great starting point for those who want to step
                                their foot in
                                the world
                                of development. They are easy to learn and implement. JavaScript and PHP are some of the
                                easiest
                                scripting
                                languages.</li>
                            <li>Open-source and free- Most of the scripting languages are open-sourced, which means
                                there are no limits
                                on who
                                can utilize scripting languages. All they have to do now is study them and integrate
                                them into their
                                existing
                                system. They’re all open-source, which means anyone around the world can contribute to
                                their
                                development.</li>
                            Powerful and extensible- Scripting languages are powerful (in terms of application) enough
                            so that the
                            necessary
                            tasks can be accomplished with the scripts. Scripting languages are also highly extensible,
                            i.e., you can
                            add
                            certain features if you feel them necessary.</li>
                            <li>Cross-Platform- Scripting languages offer another significant advantage: they are
                                portable and
                                cross-platform,
                                as they execute on a remote server or in the visitor’s web browser. This means they
                                don’t require any
                                additional
                                software to run, and they can be used with any browser on any operating system and
                                platform.</li>
                            <li>Lighter memory requirements- Unlike programming languages, they are not compiled,
                                instead, they are
                                interpreted.
                                Therefore, they require smaller memory from the systems running them.</li>
                            <li>Runtime Execution- An application can be configured and modified while it is running
                                using a system that
                                permits
                                code to be executed during runtime. This capacity is, in fact, the most important
                                feature that makes
                                scripting
                                languages so important in most applications. Debugging and a rich in-game console are
                                both aided by
                                runtime code
                                execution.</li>
                            <li>Safe and secure- Scripting languages have been designed with security in mind. A
                                scripting language does
                                not
                                allow any illicit operations to be performed from the script and even stops native code

            <h2 id="c1">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>We thus conclude that the execution process and environment are the fundamental differences between
                programming languages and scripting languages. Scripting languages can alternatively be described as
                extensions to existing programs (written in a programming language). The majority of programs and
                software are written in programming languages, although functionality is defined using scripting
                languages. While the programming languages are used to develop programs and software from scratch,
                scripting languages are used to incorporate additional functionalities into the program. The growing
                demands of dynamic web pages and apps have further intensified the demand for scripting languages, and
                the need for traditional programming structures to build complex software products is never going to
                cede. Scripting languages are beautiful structures that stand on the base that programming languages
                are. Both languages have their own set of pros and cons and are meant to complement each other.</p>
